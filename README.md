This is my code for the course Introduction to Computer System(15513) at Carnegie Mellon University.

update: 
all the c files in this folder is deleted deliberately because the instructor doesn't allow the sharing of code. 
however, if you have any questions about any projects, I'm more than happy to help you. Feel free to contact jiaxingh@andrew.cmu.edu
